## About me

I am a dedicated person, organised, structured and attentive to detail and I am open to learn. 
I was working in a different domain , but I want to start a carrier as QA.
Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.
I would like to receive an opportunity to develop my skills and to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain experience. 

## CV

## Books I have read
__"Testing dot com"__ R.Savin 2017 (in Russian) - an excellent book for a very beginners. It explains the general goals and basic techniques in software testing.

__"A Practitioner's Guide to Software Test Design"__ Lee Copeland 2004 - comprehensive explanation of the fundamental techniques and approaches used in software testing.
